# Getting Started: Installing Key Python Libraries for Machine Learning


The goal of these instructions is to prepare you with the essential Python libraries for data science, machine learning, and deep learning experiments.

Essential Libraries
-	NumPy: Core library for n-dimensional array operations and mathematical functions.
-	SciPy: Extends NumPy with additional scientific computing capabilities.
-	Matplotlib: Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
-	Pandas: Advanced data structures and data analysis tools built on NumPy.
-	Scikit-Learn: Efficient library for implementing machine learning algorithms and data mining.
-	TensorFlow: Googleâ€™s open-source library for deep learning, also supports a variety of traditional machine learning tasks.
-	Keras: High-level deep learning API, included within TensorFlow as tf.keras, simplifying model creation and training.
